# Introduction to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

## Why This Matters to You

Kubernetes isn't just another tech trend—it's becoming the foundation of modern software deployment. Consider these numbers:
- **96%** of surveyed organizations have adopted Kubernetes
- **92%** market share in container orchestration
- **5.6 million developers** worldwide (31% of all backend developers) use it

Whether you're in security, development, system administration, data science, or engineering, Kubernetes knowledge is rapidly becoming essential.

## The Story Behind Kubernetes

### Google's Borg: Where It All Began

Before Kubernetes existed, Google faced a challenge: how to manage applications across thousands of computers efficiently. Their solution was **Borg**, an internal system that:

- **Automated resource allocation** - decided which computers should run which tasks
- **Maximized efficiency** - ensured servers weren't sitting idle
- **Maintained high availability** - kept critical applications running even when hardware failed
- **Recovered quickly** from failures

Think of a Borg cluster like a massive data center organized into "cells"—each containing thousands of different servers (varying in CPU, memory, storage, and network capacity).

### How Borg Worked

**The Container Concept**: A Borg "task" is like a shipping container for software—it bundles your application code with everything it needs to run (dependencies, configurations) so it can run reliably anywhere.

**Job Scheduling**: Borg used a quota system:
- Each job had a priority level
- Jobs with higher quotas ran first
- Resources were allocated based on importance

**Scalability Through Smart Design**:
- Parallel processing across thousands of machines
- Could evict lower-priority jobs to make room for critical ones
- Distributed jobs across different failure domains (machines, racks, power sources) to prevent correlated failures

### What Kubernetes Changed

When Google open-sourced Borg's concepts as "Kubernetes" (Greek for "captain" or "helmsman"), they made key improvements:

**Simplified Networking**: 
- **Borg**: One IP address per machine → complicated port management
- **Kubernetes**: One IP address per pod → much simpler

**Labels Over Jobs**: Instead of Borg's rigid job structure, Kubernetes uses flexible labels to organize and manage resources (for monitoring, security policies, networking, etc.).

**Democratized Access**: Borg gave power users 230+ parameters to optimize their applications. Kubernetes simplified this for everyone.

## Understanding Kubernetes (K8s)

**What is it?** An open-source orchestrator that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### The Traditional Problem

**Old way:**
1. Developers package application → send to operations team
2. Ops team installs dependencies, creates configs, sets up infrastructure
3. Result: Slow deployments, delays, high costs

**Container solution:**
Developers package everything (app + dependencies + configs) into a portable container image that runs anywhere.

### Key Concepts

**Pods**: The smallest unit in Kubernetes
- Wraps one or more containers
- Think of it as a single deployable unit
- Contains your application running in containers

**What Kubernetes Does**:
- Deploys and redeploys containers automatically
- Monitors application health
- Scales up/down based on demand
- Rolls back failed deployments

## Amazon EKS: The Orchestrator's Orchestrator

Here's the key relationship to understand:

```
EKS orchestrates → Kubernetes clusters
Kubernetes orchestrates → Pods (containerized applications)
```

### Two-Level Management

**Level 1 - EKS manages Kubernetes clusters:**
- Creates and destroys entire K8s clusters
- Handles infrastructure lifecycle
- Tools: AWS Console, `aws eks`, `eksctl`

**Level 2 - Kubernetes manages applications:**
- Creates and destroys pods, services, deployments
- Handles application lifecycle
- Tools: `kubectl`, `Helm`

### The Challenge EKS Solves

Kubernetes has two planes that must communicate:
- **Control Plane**: The brain (makes decisions)
- **Data Plane**: The muscle (runs applications)

Setting up and maintaining this communication—especially in the cloud with security, networking, and storage—is complex. **EKS handles this complexity for you.**

### What EKS Provides

**Managed Control Plane**: 
- AWS installs, patches, and maintains the control plane
- You don't worry about these critical components

**Worker Node Options** (where your apps actually run):

1. **Self-managed**: You're on your own (full control, full responsibility)

2. **Managed nodes** (Hybrid):
   - AWS maintains the operating system images
   - You deploy those images and update nodes when new versions are released
   - Shared responsibility

3. **Fargate** (Serverless):
   - AWS handles everything
   - Zero infrastructure management
   - You just run your applications

**Enhanced Integration**:
- Seamless connection with AWS services (networking, storage, security)
- Built-in security enhancements
- Add-ons for monitoring, logging, and AWS resource interaction

## Quick Check: Do You Understand?

Before moving forward, can you answer these in your own words:

1. What's the difference between EKS and Kubernetes?
2. What problem do containers solve compared to traditional deployment?
3. What are the three worker node options in EKS, and how do they differ in responsibility?

Take a moment to think about these—they're the foundation for everything else in this book.
